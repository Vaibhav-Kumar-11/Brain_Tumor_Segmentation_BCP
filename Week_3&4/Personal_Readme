# Brain Tumor Segmentation using U-Net (BraTS 2021)

---

## Project Overview

This project implements a deep learning–based system for automatic brain tumor segmentation from MRI scans.  
A U-Net architecture is trained using the BraTS 2021 dataset to predict tumor regions from MRI slices.

The work is done as part of **Week 3** of the Winter in Data Science program and builds upon the fundamentals covered in earlier weeks such as NumPy, image handling, and PyTorch basics.

## Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to design and train a neural network that can accurately segment brain tumors from MRI images.  
The model takes MRI slices as input and generates corresponding segmentation masks that highlight tumor regions.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- NiBabel
- PyTorch
- Google Colab

## Approach

The overall workflow of the project is as follows:

1. Load MRI volumes and segmentation masks using NiBabel  
2. Convert 3D MRI volumes into 2D slices  
3. Normalize and resize the MRI slices  
4. Prepare paired image-mask datasets  
5. Implement a U-Net based segmentation model  
6. Train the model using Binary Cross Entropy loss  
7. Evaluate performance using Dice Score  
8. Visualize predicted masks against ground truth  
9. Save the trained model for future use
